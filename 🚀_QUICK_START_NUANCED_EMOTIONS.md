- **Forced smiles** (tense body + fake smile)

- **40+ nuanced emotions** instead of just "happy, sad, angry"

## 📊 What's Been Upgraded

### ✅ Tested & Working

| Video | Frames | Nuanced Emotions |
|-------|--------|------------------|
| **Highway** (Alia Bhatt) | 14 | nervous anticipation, concealed frustration, sarcasm, defiant confrontation |
| **Farzi** (Shahid Kapoor) | 3 | concealed tension, passive aggression, triumphant joy |

### ⏳ Still Old Emotions (Need Reprocessing)

All other videos in your library still use generic emotions (happy, sad, angry).

## 🧠 How It Works

The system combines **3 signals**:

1. **Visual Analysis**
   - Facial expression (smile type, eye tension)
   - Body language (posture, tension)
   - Scene mood (lighting, framing)

2. **Transcript Analysis**
   - Dialogue tone (sincere, sarcastic, threatening)
   - Word choice
   - Emotional subtext

3. **Context Fusion**
   - Combines visual + transcript
   - Resolves conflicts (smile + negative dialogue = sarcasm)
   - Generates nuanced emotion

**Example:**
- Visual: Person smiling
- Transcript: "Oh wow, that was brilliant." (sarcastic)
- **Result:** `sarcasm`, `passive aggression` (NOT "happy")

---

## 📝 Quick Tips

### ✅ DO
- Search using emotional nuance: "nervous anticipation", "forced smile"
- Reprocess important videos for better emotion detection
- Trust the system when it detects sarcasm/tension

### ❌ DON'T
- Expect old videos to have nuanced emotions (they need reprocessing)
- Search for generic "happy" or "sad" (be specific!)
- Assume all smiles are "happy" (system now differentiates)
