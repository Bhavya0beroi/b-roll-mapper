## 🧠 How Context Changes Emotion

### Scenario: Person Smiling

| Transcript Context | Visual Cues | Detected Emotion |
|-------------------|-------------|------------------|
| "That's amazing!" + joy | Relaxed eyes, open body | `genuine happiness` |
| "Oh wow, brilliant." + sarcasm | Cold eyes, tight lips | `sarcasm`, `passive aggression` |
| "We're in trouble..." + tension | Tense body, nervous | `nervous anticipation`, `forced smile` |
| "Everything as planned..." + menace | Calculating eyes | `sinister satisfaction`, `manipulation` |

**The system now understands that the same visual (smile) means different things in different contexts!**
