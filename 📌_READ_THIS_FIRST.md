## 🔍 ISSUE #1: "Visual Search Not Working"

### ✅ HERE'S WHY:

**Your existing 15 videos DON'T have visual data yet!**

The visual analysis feature was just added. Your videos were uploaded BEFORE this feature existed, so they only have audio transcripts.

### ✅ HOW TO FIX (Takes 30 seconds):

**SEE THE NEW BUTTONS**:
1. Open tool in browser
2. Go to Video Library
3. **Hover over ANY video card**
4. You'll see 2 buttons appear:
   - **🎨 Add Visual** (purple button)
   - **🗑️** (red delete button)

**CLICK "ADD VISUAL"**:
1. Click the purple "🎨 Add Visual" button
2. Confirm the dialog
3. Wait ~30-60 seconds
4. Alert: "Visual analysis complete!"

**NOW IT WORKS**:
1. Search for visual content: "laptop", "phone", "office"
2. You'll see purple "🎨 Visual" badges in results!
3. Those are the visual matches!

## 🔍 ISSUE #2: "Thank You" for "Good Job"

### ✅ THIS IS CORRECT!

**"Thank you" appearing for "good job" is EXACTLY how semantic search should work!**

**Why**:
- "Good job" = praise, appreciation
- "Thank you" = gratitude, appreciation
- **Both are expressions of appreciation** = Semantically related! ✅

**Similarity Scores**:
- "Congratulation" - 56% (very related)
- "Thank you" - 46% (related)

**This proves your semantic search IS working correctly!** 🧠

If you only wanted exact "good job" matches, that would be keyword search (not semantic).

## 🔍 ISSUE #3: Light Mode Text Hard to Read

### ✅ FIXED!

**Changes Made**:
- Headers: Now dark gray/black in light mode
- Video titles: Now dark gray/black
- Metadata: Now darker for better contrast

**Test It**:
1. Click ☀️ Light button in header
2. Check Video Library section
3. Text should now be easily readable!

## 🔍 ISSUE #4: Need Delete Button

### ✅ ADDED!

**How to Use**:
1. Hover over any video in library
2. Red 🗑️ button appears at bottom-right
3. Click to delete
4. Confirms before deleting
5. Removes everything (video, clips, frames, thumbnail)

→ 2 results (audio transcript matches only)
```

### After Adding Visual:
```
Search "laptop"
Results:
🎤 "I'm using my laptop" (82% - audio)
🎨 [Visual] Person typing on laptop... (78% - visual!)
🎤 "Open your laptop" (68% - audio)
