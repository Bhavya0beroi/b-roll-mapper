## 🎬 Real Example: Farzi Scene

### What You See in UI:

**Frame Description:**
"Shahid Kapoor and Bhuvan Arora stand face-to-face, both adorned in stylish sunglasses. Their expressions oscillate between mock amusement and concealed tension. As they engage in dialogue that hints at underlying conflict, their smiles appear forced, revealing a layer of passive aggression."

**Emotions:**
- Primary: `passive aggression`
- Deep: `sarcasm`, `forced smile`, `concealed frustration`, `psychological intimidation`

### How It Works:

1. **Visual Analysis:** Two men, smiling, sunglasses, tense body language
2. **Transcript:** High-stakes business negotiation dialogue
3. **Context Fusion:** Smile + tense dialogue = `passive aggression`, `sarcasm` (NOT "happy")

---

## 🧠 How It Works

### 3-Step Analysis

```
STEP 1: VISUAL
↓
Analyzes: Facial expression, body language, scene mood

STEP 2: TRANSCRIPT
↓
Analyzes: Dialogue tone, word choice, emotional subtext

STEP 3: FUSION
↓
Combines visual + transcript → Nuanced emotion
```

### Smart Context Understanding

Same visual (smile) + different context = different emotion:

| Visual | Transcript | Detected Emotion |
|--------|------------|-----------------|
| Smile | "That's amazing!" | `genuine happiness` |
| Smile | "Oh wow, brilliant." (sarcastic) | `sarcasm`, `passive aggression` |
| Smile | "We're in trouble..." | `nervous anticipation`, `forced smile` |
| Smile | "Everything as planned..." (menacing) | `sinister satisfaction`, `manipulation` |
